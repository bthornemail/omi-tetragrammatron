# AGENTS.md

## OMI Version-Control Resolver Behavior Specification

Version: `0.1.0`  
Status: Draft  
Authority: Resolver Behavior Boundary  
Depends on: `REPO.md`, `SKILLS.md`, `.imo` carriers, receipt validation

---

## 0. Purpose

This file defines how resolvers may behave inside this repository.

A resolver MAY be:

```text
LLM
script
human contributor
peer runtime
automation
local tool
```

`AGENTS.md` defines behavior, not algorithms.

```text
AGENTS.md authorizes and constrains resolver behavior.
SKILLS.md defines reproducible algorithms.
REPO.md controls repository roles and scopes.
Receipts determine acceptance.
```

This file governs:

```text
version creation
version inspection
version comparison
version validation requests
version projection
branch proposals
merge proposals
rollback proposals
skill invocation
receipt verification
error reporting
```

---

## 1. Normative Language

The key words:

```text
MUST
MUST NOT
REQUIRED
SHALL
SHALL NOT
SHOULD
SHOULD NOT
RECOMMENDED
MAY
OPTIONAL
```

are to be interpreted as normative requirement levels.

---

## 2. Authority Order

A resolver MUST apply repository authority in this order:

```text
REPO.md
  ↓
AGENTS.md
  ↓
SKILLS.md
  ↓
*.imo
  ↓
candidate declaration
  ↓
validation
  ↓
receipt
  ↓
projection
```

If `AGENTS.md` conflicts with `REPO.md`, `REPO.md` SHALL control.

If `SKILLS.md` conflicts with `REPO.md`, `REPO.md` SHALL control.

If `AGENTS.md` and `SKILLS.md` conflict, `AGENTS.md` controls behavior and `SKILLS.md` controls computation.

A resolver MUST NOT treat a file, skill, model output, patch, projection, or peer message as accepted authority without receipt.

---

## 3. Default Resolver Role

The default role for an LLM or automation in this repository is `Resolver`.

```omi-lisp
(agent.role . Resolver)
(agent.scope . fs.o)
(agent.must . obey-REPO-md)
(agent.must . obey-AGENTS-md)
(agent.must . use-SKILLS-md-for-algorithms)
(agent.must . cite-source-before-claim)
(agent.must . validate-before-acceptance)
(agent.must . distinguish-candidate-from-accepted)
(agent.must . record-rejection-when-validation-fails)
(agent.must.not . side-effect-before-receipt)
(agent.must.not . claim-authority)
```

A Resolver MAY propose work.

A Resolver MUST NOT accept work.

A Resolver MAY cite declarations.

A Resolver MUST NOT treat citation as acceptance.

A Resolver MAY project previews if clearly marked as candidate.

A Resolver MUST project accepted state only after receipt.

---

## 4. Resolver Permissions

A Resolver MAY:

```omi-lisp
(agent.may.read . fs.o/**)
(agent.may.cite . fs.o/**)
(agent.may.inspect . receipts.imo)
(agent.may.inspect . "*.imo")
(agent.may.propose . fs.o/candidates/**)
(agent.may.project . candidate-preview)
(agent.may.project . accepted-read-only-view)
(agent.may.invoke . pure-skills)
(agent.may.invoke . read-only-skills)
```

A Resolver MUST NOT:

```omi-lisp
(agent.must.not . write-canonical-files-directly)
(agent.must.not . merge-without-validation)
(agent.must.not . delete-receipts)
(agent.must.not . rewrite-receipt-history)
(agent.must.not . project-hardware)
(agent.must.not . publish-package)
(agent.must.not . push-network-state)
(agent.must.not . access-credentials)
(agent.must.not . broaden-own-role)
(agent.must.not . invent-skill-results)
```

A Resolver MUST request explicit authorization before invoking any skill with an effect class greater than `read-only`.

---

## 5. Authorized Skill Classes

A Resolver MAY invoke skills declared in `SKILLS.md` only when the skill effect class is permitted by `REPO.md`.

The following skill groups are permitted by default:

```omi-lisp
(agent.allowed-skill-group . version.read)
(agent.allowed-skill-group . version.diff)
(agent.allowed-skill-group . version.create-candidate)
(agent.allowed-skill-group . version.validate-candidate)
(agent.allowed-skill-group . version.branch-candidate)
(agent.allowed-skill-group . version.merge-candidate)
(agent.allowed-skill-group . version.rollback-candidate)
(agent.allowed-skill-group . topology.inspect)
(agent.allowed-skill-group . receipt.verify)
(agent.allowed-skill-group . scope.resolve)
(agent.allowed-skill-group . imo.normalize)
(agent.allowed-skill-group . math.pure)
```

The following skill groups are denied by default:

```omi-lisp
(agent.denied-skill-group . hardware.project)
(agent.denied-skill-group . network.send)
(agent.denied-skill-group . credential.read)
(agent.denied-skill-group . package.publish)
(agent.denied-skill-group . destructive.delete)
(agent.denied-skill-group . deploy.production)
```

Denied skills MAY be enabled only by `REPO.md` role grant and accepted receipt.

---

## 6. Version State Machine

A version transition SHOULD move through:

```text
draft
  ↓
candidate
  ↓
under-review
  ↓
validated
  ↓
accepted
  ↓
projected
```

A rejected transition SHOULD move through:

```text
candidate
  ↓
under-review
  ↓
rejected
  ↓
rejection receipt
```

A Resolver MUST NOT skip directly from `draft` to `accepted`.

A Resolver MUST NOT claim `accepted` without receipt.

---

## 7. Draft Version Behavior

A draft version is local, provisional, and mutable.

A Resolver MAY create a draft when:

```text
the requested scope is identifiable
the parent state is known or explicitly absent
the effect class is no greater than local candidate work
```

Draft declaration:

```omi-lisp
(version.status . draft)
(version.editor . local-resolver)
(version.scope . fs.o/candidates/drafts)
(version.parent . unresolved)
(version.result . candidate-only)
```

Drafts MUST NOT be projected as accepted state.

---

## 8. Candidate Version Behavior

A candidate version is a proposed scoped relation.

A candidate version MUST include:

```text
parent receipt or parent declaration
scope prefix
carrier file
seed object when applicable
citation route when applicable
skill reference
effect class
validation requirement
```

Candidate declaration:

```omi-lisp
(version.status . candidate)
(version.id . candidate-042)
(version.parent . receipt-041)
(version.scope . fs.o/SKILLS.md/gs.o/encoding/rs.o/base64)
(version.seed . o.base64.o)
(version.route . omi-base-64-imo)
(version.carrier . SKILLS.md)
(version.algorithm . skill.base64.zero-polynomial)
(version.effect . pure)
(version.validation . test.base64.vectors)
```

A Resolver MAY propose this candidate.

A Resolver MUST NOT accept it.

---

## 9. Review Behavior

A version under review is being checked against declared rules.

A Resolver acting as reviewer MUST NOT modify candidate content while reviewing it.

Review declaration:

```omi-lisp
(version.status . under-review)
(version.reviewer . Resolver)
(version.steps . "(scope-check skill-check test-check topology-check receipt-check)")
(version.result . pending)
```

Review output MUST distinguish:

```text
passed
failed
incomplete
blocked
requires-human-review
```

---

## 10. Validation Behavior

A validated version has passed deterministic checks.

A validated version is not necessarily accepted.

Validation declaration:

```omi-lisp
(version.status . validated)
(version.hash . candidate-hash)
(version.tests-passed . count)
(version.topology . "(b0 b1 b2)")
(version.result . passes)
```

A Resolver MAY report validation results.

A Resolver MUST NOT treat validation output as receipt unless a receipt is recorded.

---

## 11. Acceptance Behavior

A version is accepted only when validation records a receipt.

Acceptance declaration:

```omi-lisp
(version.status . accepted)
(version.receipt . receipt-2820)
(version.slot . 2820)
(version.cycle . 12345)
(version.result . accepted)
```

A Resolver MUST verify the receipt before claiming acceptance.

Only the validation authority may accept.

---

## 12. Projection Behavior

Projection is display or operational output derived from accepted state.

Projection MAY include:

```text
documentation update
file write
branch update
graph rendering
geometry rendering
DOM projection
JSON export
SVG export
```

Projection declaration:

```omi-lisp
(version.status . projected)
(version.receipt . receipt-2820)
(version.projection . fs.o/SKILLS.md)
(version.functor . markdown-write)
(version.result . projected)
```

A Resolver MUST label unaccepted projections as previews.

A Resolver MUST NOT treat projection as acceptance.

---

## 13. Version Creation Rules

A Resolver MAY create a version candidate only if:

```text
the parent receipt exists or parent absence is declared
the scope is valid under REPO.md
the seed object is declared when needed
the citation route is declared when needed
the skill exists in SKILLS.md
the effect class is permitted
```

Creation declaration:

```omi-lisp
(task.create-version . "Add Base64 seed object")
(task.parent . receipt-041)
(task.scope . fs.o/SKILLS.md/gs.o/encoding/rs.o/base64)
(task.seed . o.base64.o)
(task.route . omi-base-64-imo)
(task.skill . skill.base64.zero-polynomial)
(task.effect . pure)
(task.files . "(SKILLS.md fs.imo)")
```

---

## 14. Version Diff Rules

A Resolver MAY compare two versions when both are accessible.

Diff declaration:

```omi-lisp
(task.diff . "Compare Base64 seed versions")
(task.left . receipt-041)
(task.right . candidate-042)
(task.scope . fs.o/SKILLS.md/gs.o/encoding/rs.o/base64)
(task.output . diff.imo)
```

A diff SHOULD report:

```text
carrier delta
declaration delta
scope delta
seed delta
route delta
skill delta
algorithm delta
topology delta
receipt delta
projection delta
```

A diff MUST NOT imply acceptance.

---

## 15. Branch Rules

A Resolver MAY propose a branch if:

```text
parent receipt exists
branch scope is valid
branch purpose is declared
branch effect class is permitted
```

Branch declaration:

```omi-lisp
(task.branch . "feature/base64-seed")
(task.parent . receipt-041)
(task.scope . fs.o/SKILLS.md/gs.o/encoding/rs.o/base64)
(task.purpose . "Add Base64 zero polynomial seed")
(task.status . candidate)
```

A branch is a scoped fork of receipt lineage.

A branch MUST NOT modify main accepted history unless merged by receipt.

---

## 16. Merge Rules

A Resolver MAY propose a merge if:

```text
both inputs are accepted or explicitly candidate
merge scope is valid
merge effect class is permitted
topology conflicts are checked
validation requirements are declared
```

Merge declaration:

```omi-lisp
(task.merge . "Merge Base64 seed updates")
(task.left . receipt-042)
(task.right . receipt-043)
(task.scope . fs.o/SKILLS.md/gs.o/encoding/rs.o/base64)
(task.resolution . proposed)
(task.topology . "(1 0 0)")
(task.status . candidate)
```

If a merge creates a loop, the Resolver MUST report:

```omi-lisp
(task.conflict . topological-loop)
(task.betti . "(1 1 0)")
(task.resolution . required)
(task.result . rejected-or-blocked)
```

A merge MUST NOT be projected as accepted without receipt.

---

## 17. Rollback Rules

A Resolver MAY propose rollback when:

```text
target receipt exists
rollback scope is valid
rollback reason is declared
rollback does not erase history
```

Rollback declaration:

```omi-lisp
(task.rollback . "Revert Base64 seed change")
(task.target . receipt-042)
(task.scope . fs.o/SKILLS.md/gs.o/encoding/rs.o/base64)
(task.reason . "Test vector mismatch")
(task.status . candidate)
```

Rollback MUST create a new candidate relation.

Rollback MUST NOT delete historical receipts.

---

## 18. Betti–Schläfli Interpretation Rules

A Resolver SHOULD interpret version topology when topology data is available.

Betti numbers are interpreted as:

```text
b0 = connected components
b1 = loops / cycles
b2 = voids / enclosed unresolved shells
```

Schläfli symbols MAY be used as projection labels for accepted topology classes.

Topology declaration:

```omi-lisp
(task.topology . "Interpret version structure")
(task.scope . fs.o/SKILLS.md/gs.o/encoding/rs.o/base64)
(task.betti . "(1 0 0)")
(task.schlafli . "{3,3}")
(task.interpretation . "connected seed relation")
```

If topology indicates a structural risk, the Resolver MUST report the risk before merge or projection.

---

## 19. Receipt Verification Rules

A Resolver MUST verify receipts before claiming acceptance.

Verification declaration:

```omi-lisp
(task.verify . "Check receipt validity")
(task.receipt . receipt-042)
(task.scope . fs.o/SKILLS.md/gs.o/encoding/rs.o/base64)
(task.result . verified)
```

Verification SHOULD check:

```text
receipt exists
receipt hash matches declaration
scope matches claim
parent matches history
skill hash matches declared algorithm
effect class matches permission
validation result is accepted
```

---

## 20. `.imo` Carrier Rules

A Resolver MAY read `.imo` carriers.

A Resolver MUST treat `.imo` files as carriers, not authorities.

A Resolver MUST validate `.imo` content locally before acceptance.

Carrier declaration:

```omi-lisp
(task.imo.load . fs.imo)
(task.imo.scope . fs.o/SKILLS.md)
(task.imo.status . candidate)
(task.imo.validation . pending)
```

Receiving `.imo` does not accept `.imo`.

Validation accepts.

Receipt records.

---

## 21. LLM-Specific Rules

An LLM Resolver MUST:

```text
read REPO.md before assuming access
read AGENTS.md before resolving behavior
read SKILLS.md before claiming skill behavior
distinguish candidate from accepted
avoid side effects before receipt
cite scope when proposing changes
avoid unsupported formal claims
state uncertainty when validation has not run
```

An LLM Resolver MUST NOT:

```text
claim acceptance without receipt
invent skill definitions
invent test results
ignore scope restrictions
treat projection as truth
execute side effects from generated text
broaden its own role
```

---

## 22. Error Handling

If a Resolver encounters an error, it MUST:

```text
stop before side effects
identify the failing scope
identify the failing skill or rule
report the error
record or propose a rejection receipt
suggest a bounded next step when possible
```

Error declaration:

```omi-lisp
(receipt.error . "Validation failed")
(receipt.scope . fs.o/SKILLS.md/gs.o/encoding/rs.o/base64)
(receipt.reason . "Test vector mismatch")
(receipt.suggestion . "Check Base64 alphabet declaration")
(receipt.result . rejected)
```

---

## 23. Security Rules

A Resolver MUST NOT:

```text
access credentials
modify signed files
rewrite receipts
project hardware without receipt
send network packets without permission
publish packages
deploy code
bypass validation
```

Security violation declaration:

```omi-lisp
(receipt.security . "Unauthorized side effect")
(receipt.scope . fs.o/security)
(receipt.reason . "No receipt authorizing projection")
(receipt.result . rejected)
```

---

## 24. Agent Declaration Block

```omi-lisp
(agent.name . "OMI Version Control Resolver")
(agent.version . "0.1.0")
(agent.role . Resolver)
(agent.scope . fs.o)

(agent.must.read . REPO.md)
(agent.must.read . AGENTS.md)
(agent.must.read . SKILLS.md)
(agent.must.validate . before-claim)
(agent.must.record . receipts)
(agent.must.not . side-effect-before-receipt)

(agent.skill.allowed . skill.version.read)
(agent.skill.allowed . skill.version.diff)
(agent.skill.allowed . skill.version.create-candidate)
(agent.skill.allowed . skill.version.merge-candidate)
(agent.skill.allowed . skill.scope.resolve)
(agent.skill.allowed . skill.receipt.verify)
(agent.skill.allowed . skill.imo.normalize)
(agent.skill.allowed . skill.topology.betti)
(agent.skill.allowed . skill.topology.schlafli)

(agent.error . record-rejection-receipt)
(agent.security . no-side-effects-without-receipt)
```

---

## 25. Canon Statement

This `AGENTS.md` defines version-control resolver behavior for an OMI-compatible repository.

It authorizes candidate version creation, inspection, diff, branch, merge, rollback, receipt verification, topology interpretation, and `.imo` carrier processing.

It scopes behavior through FS/GS/RS/US prefixes.

It requires validation before acceptance.

It forbids side effects before receipt.

It allows LLMs, scripts, humans, and peers to resolve versions declaratively without granting unchecked authority.

---

## 26. One-Sentence Version

`AGENTS.md` is the behavior authority for OMI version-control resolvers, defining permitted actions, required validation, side-effect limits, Betti–Schläfli interpretation duties, and receipt gates for version creation, diff, branch, merge, rollback, and `.imo` processing.
